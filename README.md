When you  help you plant a seed .And expect something big after Helping ðŸ¤­
I have kids and many people that I take care of but the most difficult thing I have experienced is luck of enough food to give them
But right now I have put an eye on the world to seek help from all corners of the countries to support me in the struggle
Let me hope someone is getting me.
I will be updating you on any questions you may askðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
